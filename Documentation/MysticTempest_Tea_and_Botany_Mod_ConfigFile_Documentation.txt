MysticTempest_Tea_and_Botany_Mod_ConfigFile_Documentation.txt
================================================================

My Content Patcher based Tea mod generates a "config.json" file on first startup.
It's located in the "MysticTempest_Tea_and_Botany_Mod" folder that you added to your SDV mods folder.

--------------------------------------------------

The default values generated are as follows:

  "BotanyModDisabled": "true",
  "ClassicTeaTextureDisabled": "true",
  "CompatibilityWithArtisanValley": "false"


--------------------------------------------------

BotanyModDisabled: 
		Set to 'true' by default; it disables the experimental/abandoned, but fully usable Botany expansion I had worked on. 
		When set to 'false', it enables the Botany expansion; adding a few more of my favorite crops, recipes and machine ideas.


ClassicTeaTextureDisabled: 
		Set to 'true' by default; it disables my old tea mod sprites in favor of my updated textures.
		When set to 'false', it brings back the classic textures.


CompatibilityWithArtisanValley: 
		Set to 'false' by default; it keeps my Tea mod unchanged from before.
		When set to 'true' though; my original Tea recipes will be disabled, and alternates will be provided that will allow cooking of my Tea items, as well as ArtisanValley's or other Tea mods.

		-----------
		Extra notes: 
				Currently compatibility is only tweaked for the following items:
						"White Tea"
						"Black Tea"
					    "Pecan Pie" - from my Botany expansion.


				This is done by adding a single space between the recipe words; which changes them enough for the game to see that they're different recipes.
				If you already had the old recipes, you'll have to check your mail again for the new recipes to come. Otherwise, you will receive them as normal.

				Also, do note that old versions of the items listed above; that were cooked with the original recipe will not be stackable with any newer versions. 
				However, older versions of the items listed above are still 100% available for all other uses, and vice-versa.
				This occurs because the new cooking recipes create different items that are remapped to the original items as much as possible so as not to cause breakage.
