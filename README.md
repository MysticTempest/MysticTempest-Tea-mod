MysticTempest-Tea-mod
------------------------------

This is my original Tea mod with my experimental, but fully usable Botany expansion.
The Botany expansion is disabled by default but can be re-enabled through the generated config file.

My Tea mod adds Tea as a crop, recipes to make & artisan items to sell.

The Botany expansion includes new crops, recipes, artisan items & craftable machines to use.
